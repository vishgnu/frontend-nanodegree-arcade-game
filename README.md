* Your lives will be shown within the heart and you can see your score will show
        on the star.
* After you have reached the water you need to take one more step up to get back to
        the starting position and claim you points.
* When you got caught by the bugs you will be repositioned to the start  and you will
        loose one live.
* After  you have no lives left you will restart fresh with 0 points and 3 lives.
 

## Happy Gaming!
